Our assignement is working, however you need to import our database in your Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio as Hospital.
And you need to recreate the Hospital.dbml. (Suppress the current Hospital.dbml. Then, add new element > LINQ > Name it Hopsital.dbml > Add the 3 tables > Save) It's an issue on visual studio we can't do nothing.
Best regards.
